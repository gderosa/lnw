lnw &ndash; Linux Network Web (API and UI).

## FastAPI backend
Plus Alpine.js UI (for now at least).

## Opinionated

* Debian centric (both PC-like and RaspberryOS/Raspbian)
* Persists network config with **networkd/systemd**
    * Not NetworkManager
    * Not `/etc/network/interfaces`
        * Less Debian-centric in this sense
